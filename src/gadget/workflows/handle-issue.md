description: Automatically handles a GitHub issue from branch creation to implementation and AI review.
---

1. Ask the user: "Please provide the GitHub Issue ID or Issue Number you would like me to work on." Wait for their input.
2. Read the issue using the `gh issue view <issue-id>` command. Analyze the issue details and the project context **very thoroughly**: understand every requirement, edge case, acceptance criteria, and any related context before proceeding. Summarize your analysis results and add them as a comment to the issue using `gh issue comment <issue-id> -b "<summary>"`.
3. Determine an appropriate branch name containing the issue identifier (e.g., `issue-<id>-brief-description`).
4. Support independent code development by creating a new worktree and branch, and change into the new directory to isolate your work: `git worktree add ../<branch-name> -b <branch-name> && cd ../<branch-name>`.
5. Based on your analysis in step 2, write a detailed implementation plan and add it as a comment to the issue using `gh issue comment <issue-id> -b "<plan>"`.
6. Implement the code changes exactly according to the plan created in the previous step.
7. Once your implementation is ready, invoke the `@review` skill (e.g. `@[.agent/skills/review/SKILL.md]`) to analyze your changes.
8. Read the review feedback artifact (e.g., `review_results.md`) generated by the reviewing agent and iteratively refactor the code until it meets the required quality standards.
9. If the review artifact contains **no issues and no items requiring user review**, proceed with the following steps automatically:
   1. Create a pull request: `gh pr create --fill`
   2. Squash-merge the PR: `gh pr merge --squash --auto`
   3. Clean up: `git worktree remove ../<branch-name> && git branch -d <branch-name> && git push origin --delete <branch-name>`
