description: Automatically handles a GitHub issue from branch creation to implementation and AI review.
---

1. Ask the user: "Please provide the GitHub Issue ID or Issue Number you would like me to work on." Wait for their input.
2. Read the issue using the `gh issue view <issue-id>` command. Analyze the issue details and the project context.
3. Determine an appropriate branch name containing the issue identifier (e.g., `issue-<id>-brief-description`).
4. Support independent code development by creating a new worktree and branch: `git worktree add ../<branch-name> -b <branch-name>`.
5. Change into the new worktree directory `../<branch-name>` to isolate your work.
6. Implement the code changes necessary to resolve the issue based on your analysis.
7. Once your implementation is ready, invoke the `@review` skill (e.g. `@[.agent/skills/review/SKILL.md]`) to analyze your changes.
8. Read the review feedback artifact (e.g., `review_results.md`) generated by the reviewing agent and iteratively refactor the code until it meets the required quality standards.
