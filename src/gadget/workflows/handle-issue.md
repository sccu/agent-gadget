description: Automatically handles a GitHub issue from branch creation to implementation and AI review.
---

1. Ask the user: "Please provide the GitHub Issue ID or Issue Number you would like me to work on." Wait for their input.
2. Read the issue using the `gh issue view <issue-id>` command.
3. Determine an appropriate branch name containing the issue identifier (e.g., `issue-<id>-brief-description`).
4. Support independent code development by creating a new worktree and branch, and change into the new directory to isolate your work: `git worktree add ../<branch-name> -b <branch-name> && cd ../<branch-name>`.
5. Invoke the `@research` skill to deeply analyze the issue details and the project context. The skill will output a `research.md` artifact with its findings.
6. Based on the `research.md` artifact and the issue content, write a detailed implementation plan and add it as a comment to the issue using `gh issue comment <issue-id> -b "<plan>"`.
7. Implement the code changes exactly according to the plan created in the previous step.
8. Once your implementation is ready, invoke the `@review` skill to analyze your changes.
9. Read the review feedback artifact (e.g., `review_results.md`) generated by the reviewing agent and iteratively refactor the code until it meets the required quality standards.
10. If the review artifact contains **no issues and no items requiring user review**, proceed with the following steps automatically:
    1. Push and create a pull request: `git push -u origin HEAD && gh pr create --fill`
    2. Squash-merge the PR and schedule branch deletion: `gh pr merge --squash --auto --delete-branch`
    3. Clean up the local environment: `cd - && git worktree remove ../<branch-name> && git branch -D <branch-name>`
    4. Sync with remote: `git pull`
